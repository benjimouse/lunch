# lunch
An app for making the best Christmas lunch So this "app" is a tool that I'm playing with to learn about meteor and to also improve some cooking.

If you'd like to download and play please do. I'm more than happy to accept pull requests for this project if you want to improve it.

This runs under meteor (meteor.com) and is heavily influenced by the discover meteor book. (www.discovermeteor.com).

I am continuing to play with the project, but slowly...
